Assignment 1
For this project, we only use our main file accompanyed by a plethora of helper functions
We also utilized the re library in Python as that was our language of choice
The reason we went with this library were for the functions .search() and .findall() as 
the Match object created by the search was useful for finding indexes and the list from
findall would get every instance, making it easy to search for them individually

Our QA system will run with the test file of choice as a command line arguments and once
ran, will ask the user for what question they would want to ask. It then will take in the 
question and determine what type of question, between what, did, how, and invalid
If it's asking for a open or closing value, it will set the desired words to the correct regular
expressions. Otherwise, have it return the list from q_inc_or_dec which will return good words, 
bad words, both or neither. Then, the program calls a function to search the lines that contain
both the company in question and some form of the desired words set previously, then returning them.
Now, based on what kind of question, it will return it rose or fell if it is a did question,
then providing the source line and repeating for all lines. For how or what questions, it will go 
line by line from the matching lines and only print the ones with the numerical value found using find_amt
If it's invalid, it will say it's an invalid question type and if there is no answer, it will print no
answers found. This loop will continue until the user enters in QUIT as the question. 

Some issues that may come up is that the value may be the inclusion of extra characters when it comes to
certain point values that need to be grabbed. Another interesting thing was how we determined which number
value to take from a sentence using the .search command from the re library since it generates a start and end
index for those found so it was comparing to see which start was closer to the company name and choosing that 
one as the return value.
